# LeetCode solutions in C# with xUnit tests

> We had 2 higher education degrees, 75 hours of CS classes listened, 5 years of high-load production experience, 
> a saltshaker half-full of confidence, a whole galaxy of multi-colored project launched, libraries written, frameworks used, StackOverflow questions answered... 
> Also, a quart of desktop applications releases, a quart of web applications releases, a case of product maintenance, a pint of raw coding interviews passed, and two dozen tools that your employer havenâ€™t heard about. 
> Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious programming collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. 
> The only thing that really worried me was the **coding interviews**. 
> There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an **coding interviews** binge, and I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.
